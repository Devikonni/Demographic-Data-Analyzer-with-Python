# **Demographic Data Analyzer**

**Project Description**:  
This Python project analyzes demographic data extracted from the 1994 Census database using **Pandas**. The dataset contains information such as age, work class, education, marital status, occupation, and salary, and is used to answer various analytical questions, such as race distribution, average age of men, and percentage of individuals earning more than 50K based on education level.

This project is part of a curriculum challenge to develop a deeper understanding of data analysis using Python and Pandas.
